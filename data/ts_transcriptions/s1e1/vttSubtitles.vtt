We boys welcome both of you guys.

8
00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:29.450
Uh,

9
00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:30.879
the goal of this podcast is try and

10
00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:32.880
give coaches some extra information to help with their

11
00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:34.779
time coaching athletes and also give you something

12
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.419
to listen to as you're driving around Victoria,

13
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.439
coaching all these athletes at the same time,

14
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.439
there's any topics you want discussed or

15
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.159
some extra information or anything that you

16
00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:45.799
need to help with your coaching that we go over on the podcast.

17
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.380
You can grab all our details from the basketball

18
00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:49.639
Victoria website and make contact with us from there.

19
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.310
Uh,

20
00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:52.860
everyone will be happy to field all of your copious

21
00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.209
amounts of emails and everything that goes with that,

22
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.279
as we probably have a rough,

23
00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:59.139
you know, listenership of about 31

24
00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.959
a

25
00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.560
day.

26
00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:02.369
Uh,

27
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.529
so our topic this week is team selection and trials.

28
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.459
It's a fairly timely point at this stage, given.

29
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.769
Everyone's probably going through that at V JB L level.

30
00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:13.389
I know at the Bar of Victoria World,

31
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.440
we've been going through that with Southern Cross Challenge trials

32
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.949
and I

33
00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:19.584
selections for the coming year and everything that goes with it.

34
00:01:20.175 --> 00:01:20.425
But, uh,

35
00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:25.025
do you want to talk us through just your selection so far with country Justin and

36
00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:25.264
you

37
00:01:25.404 --> 00:01:25.885
guys went a bit.

38
00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:31.044
I guess ours starts with, uh, under 12 identification more than selection, uh,

39
00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:32.175
at our jamboree.

40
00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:36.160
Um, And then the last two weeks, we've had, uh, Gold Nugget camp,

41
00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:40.150
which is our under 14 selection trials for Southern Cross.

42
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.370
Um and then we've had our MITP and and cup trials as well,

43
00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:46.480
which is under fifteens through the eighteens

44
00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:47.260
uh,

45
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.589
around about 800 odd kids over that period of time. So,

46
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.489
uh, tough to to

47
00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:54.169
do.

48
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.260
But the good thing from a programme point of view

49
00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:58.230
is we feel we've left some really good athletes out,

50
00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.699
which

51
00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.699
sounds pretty mean, but we feel when we're doing that,

52
00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.300
that means our programmes are going in the right direction.

53
00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:06.430
So hopefully an exciting year ahead.

54
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.830
Definitely, Mike, what about you guys with the Metro?

55
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.389
Mm. Yeah.

56
00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.100
We just finished our SCC selections, Uh, during the school holidays,

57
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.589
the September holidays.

58
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.389
Uh, and, uh,

59
00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:19.119
those athletes will now go and and prepare for the tournament in in January.

60
00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:24.300
Uh, so NITP was selected throughout the year, Uh, across two phases of selections.

61
00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:25.779
And those athletes have just started,

62
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.380
uh, with term four now.

63
00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.259
So, uh, we kind of split up the selections for those two things across the year and,

64
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.610
uh, try to stagger the starts for both of them as well. Yeah. Awesome.

65
00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.479
And you guys have obviously got a lot of country and metro coaches

66
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.720
involved within the NITP programme and jamboree and everything that goes to that

67
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.679
Southern cross.

68
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.149
Uh, head coaches go about getting involved in those sorts of things.

69
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.630
Best thing for us is, uh, Craig Hockley, who's based up in the Bendigo office.

70
00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.699
Uh, he does

71
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.839
a

72
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.389
great job to get out to people and make sure they're aware of what's going on. We had

73
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.380
over 40 coaches on the floor over over our selection trial period, which was

74
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.360
outstanding for us. And

75
00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.570
one thing we like to do with the trial phase is bring him in early, Do some PD with it.

76
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.309
So everyone's on the same page for the selection day.

77
00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:12.910
Uh, understand our criteria, and away we go, And, uh, it was it was really great to

78
00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:15.039
to have that opportunity. You know, we had

79
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.000
Olympic level experience there down to your first time coach. So,

80
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.119
uh, good. Good mix throughout, but a great result to have that many coaches on deck.

81
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.380
Mm. And similar with metro. Uh, the best way to get involved is just reach out.

82
00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.279
Uh, and it's awesome. And we can get

83
00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.710
new coaches involved, uh, in our camp situations and our camp environments,

84
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.570
cos that's where you you kind of, you know, pinch a drill or two.

85
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.500
But you also start to build that rapport.

86
00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.289
Um, with other coaches in the coaching fraternity,

87
00:03:43.395 --> 00:03:44.705
which I think is important, co, uh,

88
00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:49.294
coaching is a sharing kind of business. Like what? What? I what I

89
00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:50.934
value as a coach,

90
00:03:51.244 --> 00:03:53.835
uh, might also be valuable to someone else.

91
00:03:53.845 --> 00:03:57.065
And I think the more we can share and and build that culture of, uh,

92
00:03:57.074 --> 00:04:01.014
information sharing and, uh, professional development, I think that's, uh,

93
00:04:01.264 --> 00:04:02.854
the better way to go. Yeah, definitely.

94
00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:04.975
And you know I talk about this a fair bit when

95
00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:07.964
I go and present coaching courses is just steal from everyone.

96
00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:12.085
It's There are not many unique thoughts left in basketball at this stage.

97
00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:13.255
It's been around forever, but

98
00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.860
just go and steal what you can from whoever you can and

99
00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:18.048
just build your coaching network that goes with that as well.

100
00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:18.339
It, uh,

101
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.608
it always makes you a better coach being able to talk basketball with other people.

102
00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:22.380
I think along the way,

103
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.660
I think a big thing with that as well is I know all of us came through,

104
00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:29.760
uh, getting PD just because people open the door and,

105
00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:31.910
uh, for bus or Victoria programme.

106
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.260
It's definitely an open door policy and anyone's welcome at any time. Absolutely.

107
00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:37.079
I think that's great.

108
00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.609
Well, given everyone's dealing with V JB L trials.

109
00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:43.220
At the moment, it's, uh, both country and Metro have got all their stuff done.

110
00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:45.309
Uh, I noticed some clubs have already finished, uh,

111
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.380
which is incredibly efficient by them.

112
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.950
It's, um,

113
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.489
looking at some of the trials and clubs over the weekend.

114
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.570
They've got upwards of 100 kids rolling in for for one age group in particular.

115
00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:57.420
That's that's a lot of numbers to be dealing with as well. So

116
00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:59.320
I mean, the admin side

117
00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:01.519
probably goes first from that end.

118
00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.820
Uh, most of these guys will have registered online and things like that, um,

119
00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:06.209
some of the clubs will have got out and

120
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.739
identified kids through their domestic programme as well.

121
00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:10.859
Some people give out invites.

122
00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:14.299
Some people just say, Hey, everyone, come on in and I wait, you go.

123
00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:15.140
Um,

124
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.899
in terms of sort of running your own V JB L trials.

125
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.500
What are some of the things you'd wanna cover off before that

126
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.130
initial walk in the door? And hey, here's 100 kids.

127
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.290
You gotta try and pick four or five teams from that.

128
00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:29.029
What are some of the things you'd probably look at to start off with?

129
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.809
I guess we, you know, from a state level depth charts from that under 12 age group,

130
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.540
right through and I.

131
00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:38.779
I think that'd be a great practise for clubs to to embrace is

132
00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:43.470
have some prior knowledge. Where do you see them sitting year in year out?

133
00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:45.880
It allows you to actually identify

134
00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:47.119
the new kids better,

135
00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:50.829
um, and see where they fit. Is there a need for that age group?

136
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.940
And I know some clubs have the policy of not

137
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.980
recruiting over the top of what they already have,

138
00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:58.640
so it helps make sure there's good team balance, etcetera, etcetera.

139
00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:01.269
Uh, but making sure yeah, you've got some prior knowledge,

140
00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.410
I think is is pretty valuable when you've got those

141
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.290
sorts of numbers and it should really be easier.

142
00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.899
I suppose

143
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.529
the time you get to the older age groups,

144
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.929
you probably should have kids that have been

145
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.839
in your programme between six and eight years.

146
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.410
I mean, it sounds ridiculous,

147
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.250
but you almost may not need many tryouts for your older kids

148
00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:17.049
and know who's coming through the door.

149
00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:18.559
That's that's a major one,

150
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.010
and then also know who is gonna be on the floor for you

151
00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:24.850
as a coach as well cos you can have 100 kids come in.

152
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.209
Uh, if you've got three coaches for 100 kids, it's hard to look at 33 kids each,

153
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:31.980
uh, and identify all those kids.

154
00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:35.299
So know how many coaches you're gonna need per athlete or if you've got

155
00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:37.929
a ratio that you wanna work to to make sure that every kid,

156
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.510
uh, is properly evaluated through that process as well. Yeah, definitely.

157
00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:42.420
I think it's, um,

158
00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:45.630
like a pretrial meeting of some sort with your coaches in your age group.

159
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.529
Coaches would certainly help your director of coaching

160
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.809
Whoever that may be at your club.

161
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.299
Uh, it may be worth getting in some coaches just to run your trials.

162
00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:53.730
Uh, just so you're not the one.

163
00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:55.420
I mean, if you're the head coach of that age group,

164
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.170
you're not the one trying to evaluate and pick your own team as well as try and

165
00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:00.450
make sure all the drills are running and

166
00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:02.109
the baskets are going and everything like that.

167
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.010
You guys have done that sort of thing before with yours?

168
00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:05.410
Yeah, like I think, Well,

169
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.070
speaking on the countryside like definitely having a a pretrial

170
00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:12.200
meeting where everyone understands what we're actually looking for,

171
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.989
You know, numbers that we're looking at is important as well,

172
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.720
so that everyone actually really whittles it down.

173
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.929
Something we talk to the coaches about is having their own shopping lists

174
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.670
as well and the things that they're just looking for in athletes,

175
00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:25.950
I think with what Zapp said they're about,

176
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.600
you know, know your coaches. And maybe they have something that they're looking at,

177
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.190
uh, in in each kid. But more eyes are better in my

178
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.750
And one thing that I,

179
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.109
you know,

180
00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:39.250
we found in this last selection period was making sure the coach is rotated.

181
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.109
Sounds like

182
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:40.619
a simple thing.

183
00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:40.929
But,

184
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.459
you know, it was midway through that first session and trials,

185
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.809
and the coaches that still work with the same kids

186
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.940
you got to and we rotate baskets or keep the coach where they are and

187
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.540
just get different kids through because everyone's

188
00:07:53.549 --> 00:07:55.010
got a different take on a different kid

189
00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:56.940
and a a kid

190
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.440
might make two shots for me.

191
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.100
And then I turn around and he goes, Oh, for three for you, Like it's

192
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.429
It's not a good evaluation, but your shopping list is interesting.

193
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.059
Speak a little bit about that, Cos

194
00:08:06.239 --> 00:08:08.529
uh, that's something that I think, uh,

195
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.410
all coaches and all evaluators of talent have to have,

196
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.119
because if you haven't got one, like, what are you actually looking at?

197
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.859
And how does this kid actually know what they're being,

198
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.459
uh,

199
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.250
evaluated

200
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.410
so that

201
00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:21.649
that that for us, has been, uh,

202
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.880
probably the last three years now Pretty consistent in one B.

203
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.239
One offensive ability,

204
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.809
uh, one B, one defensive ability, shooting ability, competitiveness,

205
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.070
basketball, IQ,

206
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.260
Um, you know, and just being able to understand

207
00:08:35.609 --> 00:08:37.929
out of that what we're really looking for,

208
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.808
uh, you know, so that each athlete has different elements of that, that there's in

209
00:08:42.962 --> 00:08:44.343
intrinsic parts to that, and

210
00:08:44.504 --> 00:08:47.304
everyone's gonna have a different feel for what that means. But

211
00:08:47.453 --> 00:08:48.864
they're the areas that we say.

212
00:08:48.893 --> 00:08:50.453
Oh, well, if you're going to play for the country,

213
00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:52.643
that you have to have at least three of those

214
00:08:52.653 --> 00:08:55.304
areas ticked off to a A really competent level,

215
00:08:55.864 --> 00:08:55.973
um,

216
00:08:56.883 --> 00:08:57.223
to

217
00:08:57.504 --> 00:08:57.624
the, uh

218
00:08:57.953 --> 00:08:58.073
and

219
00:08:58.463 --> 00:08:59.223
and

220
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.460
I think what's important is that you're

221
00:09:01.469 --> 00:09:04.659
evaluating things that the athlete can execute.

222
00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:07.190
Like you're not saying that your point guard gets cut or

223
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.260
gets put in a second or third team cos they're a,

224
00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:11.549
uh, subpar offensive rebounder

225
00:09:11.729 --> 00:09:13.630
like that's an unfair evaluation.

226
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.109
Um, and it's not something that goes from team to team,

227
00:09:16.229 --> 00:09:19.599
and on that as well. Like competitiveness could mean that they're an outstanding

228
00:09:20.135 --> 00:09:23.875
rebound of their position so that it can be broken into whatever. But

229
00:09:24.044 --> 00:09:28.534
100% agree that, then that way everyone's on the same page and then we can Alright,

230
00:09:28.544 --> 00:09:30.755
now we can have some robust discussion about.

231
00:09:30.765 --> 00:09:34.375
Well, do they really separate themselves in that area to someone else?

232
00:09:34.385 --> 00:09:35.734
And it's a consistency.

233
00:09:35.864 --> 00:09:39.695
The other part for me is the feedback, the rhythm, feedback, the verbal feedback.

234
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.500
Again,

235
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.059
you've got five areas that you're looking at so making sure

236
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.929
that that they understand that and and can go from there.

237
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.469
I think that's really important.

238
00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:49.580
Like you'd cover all this off in your pretrial meeting.

239
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.659
I mean, you would have your your head coach probably gets the

240
00:09:53.099 --> 00:09:54.219
in a lot of ways, the easiest job,

241
00:09:54.229 --> 00:09:56.260
because their kids tend to stand out fairly quickly.

242
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.780
Who are the best 10 kids they're looking at?

243
00:09:57.789 --> 00:09:59.979
Or however many kids they're looking to pick,

244
00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:02.580
uh, and it gets a little bit harder as you go down the list as well.

245
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.909
And I mean,

246
00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:05.010
every coach will have their own philosophy or style

247
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.520
that they want to play with or coach with,

248
00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:08.979
so it becomes a little bit harder. But I think as long as

249
00:10:09.184 --> 00:10:10.505
on the same page, uh,

250
00:10:10.515 --> 00:10:13.544
and the only way you're gonna get that is just a quick meeting before trials and say,

251
00:10:13.554 --> 00:10:14.744
Hey, here's what we're looking at

252
00:10:14.994 --> 00:10:16.094
Realistically,

253
00:10:16.234 --> 00:10:18.205
if you have a trial of 60 kids,

254
00:10:18.215 --> 00:10:21.015
the first or the best team will probably stand out fairly early.

255
00:10:21.025 --> 00:10:23.705
Probably the worst team will stand out fairly early as well.

256
00:10:23.784 --> 00:10:24.885
Then there's that middle ground,

257
00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:26.965
which is probably the hardest bit to pick out of as well.

258
00:10:26.974 --> 00:10:31.844
Cos you might have two kids that have great one V one offence, Um,

259
00:10:31.934 --> 00:10:34.065
and then two kids that have great one V one defence.

260
00:10:34.075 --> 00:10:36.705
And now you're starting to weigh up everything else that goes with it as well.

261
00:10:36.715 --> 00:10:37.974
What's the perfect number?

262
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.299
What's the perfect number? Per hoop per

263
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:41.830
per

264
00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:44.429
our

265
00:10:44.539 --> 00:10:44.919
selections

266
00:10:45.179 --> 00:10:48.030
This year. I worked on an eight player to a hoop ratio.

267
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.159
Uh, and I just found that

268
00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:52.419
athletes are able to get more reps.

269
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.289
Uh, you can play four on four.

270
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.330
if you needed to do anything three on three,

271
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.909
you can definitely work with the other other end of the basket.

272
00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:00.219
Other end of the court. But

273
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.150
eight athletes to a hoop. It just it. It seemed to work for us this year.

274
00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:06.590
It allowed coaches to when we got competitive in the

275
00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:09.830
full court to rotate three subs instead of five.

276
00:11:09.859 --> 00:11:13.700
and I felt all athletes were able to get a AAA fair crack at it. So,

277
00:11:13.979 --> 00:11:17.909
uh, eight out of baskets, kind of what we've worked out for metro camps this year.

278
00:11:17.929 --> 00:11:19.460
I think in Max is 15.

279
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.789
But if it is 15, your session plan has to fit that many.

280
00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:25.260
So there isn't standing around.

281
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.239
They're not, you know, just sitting there going, What's going on?

282
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:32.669
Like, I think your planning's pretty important. I know some of our centres.

283
00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:34.760
You got two courts, max, and that's it. So

284
00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:36.539
you gotta make do. But,

285
00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:39.250
uh, you know, to me, as long as you're fitting around,

286
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.619
that bracket 8 to 15 is coming Your max point coach, per hoop,

287
00:11:43.859 --> 00:11:45.950
Um, and then your session plan fits

288
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.419
that.

289
00:11:46.429 --> 00:11:49.619
They get lots of trial and error reps, so there's not,

290
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.500
As you said one time they get to shoot and they that the limit on that one make or miss,

291
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.700
uh, that there's multiple opportunities and

292
00:11:57.039 --> 00:11:58.380
and time to evaluate.

293
00:11:58.809 --> 00:12:00.280
That's a pretty good segue you've made there.

294
00:12:00.289 --> 00:12:02.719
It's almost like we've planned this that now we start talking about

295
00:12:02.729 --> 00:12:04.809
sort of your session plan and what the content's gonna be like.

296
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.840
How are you going to evaluate these athletes during the session? It's,

297
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.770
um I mean, in years gone by,

298
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.659
we've done a whole heap of drill work and we do sort

299
00:12:11.669 --> 00:12:13.640
of alley drill and we sort of see what that looks like.

300
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.460
And then we might do some shooting. But

301
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.010
you don't really get much of a feel.

302
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.979
I don't think for trying to evaluate talent as well. Like,

303
00:12:20.109 --> 00:12:23.020
what are some of the things that you would put into your session plans?

304
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.969
I'm really big on the competitive stuff. I wanna just

305
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.169
I could almost just watch kids play for an hour and a

306
00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:28.859
half and then try and pick the eyes out of that.

307
00:12:28.869 --> 00:12:31.710
But what are sort of the the situations I suppose you put them into

308
00:12:31.909 --> 00:12:33.109
to make assessments on them?

309
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:33.729
Yeah.

310
00:12:34.219 --> 00:12:34.330
I mean,

311
00:12:34.489 --> 00:12:34.599
Zep

312
00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:36.450
and I are similar on this and go for a Z.

313
00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:36.669
I

314
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.630
think we're on the same

315
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.260
page

316
00:12:38.609 --> 00:12:40.619
and it comes back to that shopping list as well.

317
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.179
Like if you're gonna find out if you've got one on one basketball players,

318
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:48.309
you do have to play a significant amount of something, uh, one on 12123 on three.

319
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.049
Where they are,

320
00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:50.500
uh, in those situations.

321
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.179
So to be able to evaluate if that is on your shopping list,

322
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.140
make sure the drills marry up to that really important.

323
00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:00.719
Uh, something that I put into, uh, our selection camps here is some, uh,

324
00:13:00.729 --> 00:13:02.919
form of full court passing drill.

325
00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:02.940
Uh,

326
00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:06.909
because I think it is incredibly valuable in a in an international game, you know,

327
00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:09.440
we're talking about kick a head pass, kick ahead, pass.

328
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.039
Uh, let's find out who can actually kick a head pass.

329
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.849
Uh, so if we do com competitive things one on 12 on two. I will try to,

330
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:15.960
uh,

331
00:13:15.969 --> 00:13:18.580
split those up between a shooting drill in

332
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.750
between a full court passing drill in between,

333
00:13:20.909 --> 00:13:24.530
uh, with the ultimate goal to get to some five on five full court basketball.

334
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.890
I guess I am a little bit different after hearing that

335
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.289
I for a long time now believe that I can't

336
00:13:31.299 --> 00:13:35.510
really genuinely evaluate unless I see you competing and playing.

337
00:13:35.799 --> 00:13:37.760
So we actually don't do any,

338
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:43.039
uh, kind of breakdown type stuff. We may show something once and then we're away.

339
00:13:43.349 --> 00:13:47.250
Um, but trying to get them into competitive environment as quick as possible.

340
00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:51.429
Uh, like the fundamentals are the fundamentals. And everyone can kind of do that.

341
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.369
In my opinion, when there's not a defensive player there,

342
00:13:54.659 --> 00:13:57.130
but to see them when they they're getting a little bit

343
00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.219
of pressure and that that really to me kind of separates

344
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.799
people from the pack. And,

345
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.090
uh, it was interesting, you know, like as I spoke about those trials last week,

346
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.950
huge amount of kids,

347
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.229
But it really was still quite easy to identify who the the top

348
00:14:12.239 --> 00:14:16.789
tier athletes were and who needed to go relevant to that selection criteria.

349
00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:20.340
And it was really what stood out was when we got to five on five game play,

350
00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:24.429
Um, so you know, it's just an interesting there's no right or wrong. I don't think,

351
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.460
um, and I think it depends on your numbers always. But

352
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.830
to me, that's kind of where I've got over time in the high performance evaluation.

353
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.090
Yeah, Dev and I think it's, um it's a really easy way to build it as well.

354
00:14:35.099 --> 00:14:38.020
I mean, it's when you have, you know, 100 kids on two courts.

355
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.070
You're obviously limited with how much? Five on five, you can play as well. So,

356
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.030
um,

357
00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:44.599
three on three is a really great way to get the ball through hands

358
00:14:44.609 --> 00:14:47.335
as well as everyone gets to touch the ball a little bit more.

359
00:14:47.344 --> 00:14:48.905
You can start to make assessments on them

360
00:14:49.674 --> 00:14:50.625
exactly right.

361
00:14:50.645 --> 00:14:53.554
It's You can always find out who can't defend when you're in three on three.

362
00:14:53.565 --> 00:14:56.265
And that might just be one side of the four. That doesn't necessarily need to be

363
00:14:56.625 --> 00:14:57.344
half court.

364
00:14:57.354 --> 00:14:59.484
Some of the older head coaches that I've, uh,

365
00:14:59.494 --> 00:15:03.184
been mentored by used to talk about the Yugoslavian national team and the

366
00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:03.405
PIC.

367
00:15:03.885 --> 00:15:04.455
By any chance,

368
00:15:04.674 --> 00:15:05.424
there's a few of them.

369
00:15:06.255 --> 00:15:07.614
Uh, but there's, um,

370
00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:10.614
they basically went through their whole Olympic campaign right

371
00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:13.184
up to pre tournament in three on three.

372
00:15:13.195 --> 00:15:14.304
Well, they didn't

373
00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:17.030
really get to five on five ever, which,

374
00:15:17.219 --> 00:15:21.340
you know, in a selection period of time, that was quite a few number of years back.

375
00:15:21.349 --> 00:15:22.140
Now, like,

376
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.260
I think there's something that we've learnt from that, and I think in the last,

377
00:15:26.309 --> 00:15:28.760
you know, four or five years from a last Australia point of view,

378
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.179
I think We're doing a much better job

379
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.599
in camp environment of that. Just getting the kids into play and

380
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.380
and evaluating in that way,

381
00:15:35.549 --> 00:15:35.580
I

382
00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:38.530
think it's I mean now you start to get into, um,

383
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.530
your team selection, so to speak.

384
00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:42.510
So you've started to evaluate the talent a little bit.

385
00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:47.690
How much does your system or what you wanna run dictate as to how you pick your team?

386
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.539
It's It's one of those things where,

387
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.419
um,

388
00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:53.390
probably your first five or six kids stand out fairly quickly in terms

389
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.409
of we have to pick those kids cos they're our most talented.

390
00:15:55.419 --> 00:15:58.229
But now you start looking at your end of the bench or your bench players.

391
00:15:58.479 --> 00:16:01.309
Uh, how much does that dictate on how you want to coach?

392
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.130
Compared to just how talented they are?

393
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.919
You might have a kid that's obscenely talented that

394
00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:07.460
doesn't fit your system or how you like coaching.

395
00:16:07.469 --> 00:16:08.179
Is there

396
00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:10.869
a an unwritten rule where you say, Hey,

397
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.419
we're not gonna pick that kid because they don't fit?

398
00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:14.840
Or is it your job as the coach to make that kid fit?

399
00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:18.559
I think that sparks that the old debate of my picking the 10 best players,

400
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.750
my picking players to specifically suit what I wanna do.

401
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.340
And there's a fine balance cos you absolutely want the best athletes on your team,

402
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.280
but your shopping list,

403
00:16:27.289 --> 00:16:30.320
your game plan your your philosophies as a basketball player

404
00:16:30.609 --> 00:16:33.320
as a basketball coach. Sorry, uh, come into it now,

405
00:16:33.799 --> 00:16:34.419
Um,

406
00:16:35.469 --> 00:16:37.679
I like picking the best athletes

407
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.169
and then figuring out one way or the other what to do from there.

408
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:45.309
Uh, considering my shopping list and philosophies and styles, Um,

409
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.929
but that is something that everyone needs to understand

410
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.849
personally as a coach. Like, where do you sit with that?

411
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.820
And I think there's a massive difference between system and style of play.

412
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.500
So style of play, I think,

413
00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.169
is definitely a certain type of athlete that you're looking for.

414
00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:01.500
So if you're wanting to play in the first eight seconds,

415
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.530
you can't select plotters.

416
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.939
But system you should be always able to create strengths for whoever you select.

417
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:12.949
So I think there's a really definitive difference between the two of that,

418
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.810
and that's about you knowing and being comfortable with

419
00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.530
what you can coach and my philosophy is,

420
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.729
you can coach anyone.

421
00:17:19.739 --> 00:17:22.729
You just got to figure out. What? What? Where? That actually makes that.

422
00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.118
Yeah. Whereas,

423
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.660
um you know, and especially in a club based system,

424
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.040
I'm sure there's there's layers there that here's our blueprint.

425
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.849
You gotta know that you gotta be able to do it. But then on top of that,

426
00:17:33.979 --> 00:17:37.329
most coaches, I would think, would have the freedom to then be able to

427
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.160
create what they need for that individual athlete.

428
00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:42.560
And that's important for for junior clubs.

429
00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:45.099
Uh, cos there are some in Melbourne that do run, uh,

430
00:17:45.109 --> 00:17:47.319
a similar style of play or and system of

431
00:17:47.329 --> 00:17:49.979
play from under 12 through to their senior programme.

432
00:17:49.989 --> 00:17:50.359
So,

433
00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:51.189
um,

434
00:17:51.199 --> 00:17:54.969
being across that as a as AD OC and then as a as

435
00:17:54.979 --> 00:17:58.270
a coaching staff is is critical because you have to pick teams to,

436
00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.510
uh, pick teams and athletes to to suit that.

437
00:18:00.729 --> 00:18:02.270
I think the one thing I've probably taken

438
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.979
from that is you're not gonna pick plotters,

439
00:18:03.989 --> 00:18:07.500
and it's probably a good thing that my junior career is very

440
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.599
much over cos I don't think I'd make too many groups.

441
00:18:09.609 --> 00:18:12.390
I don't think I make too many teams. I did play in all honesty, so

442
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.260
nothing's really changed a whole lot for me there at that point. But

443
00:18:15.665 --> 00:18:18.265
then we start getting into position, like is there?

444
00:18:18.614 --> 00:18:21.055
And this is another huge debate, I suppose, over anything.

445
00:18:21.064 --> 00:18:23.935
Is there such a thing as a 1234 and five anymore?

446
00:18:23.944 --> 00:18:27.415
Have we gone away from that completely like I know, people are like guards, wings,

447
00:18:27.425 --> 00:18:27.915
bigs, and

448
00:18:28.614 --> 00:18:29.015
we're all

449
00:18:29.244 --> 00:18:29.334
going.

450
00:18:29.555 --> 00:18:30.824
It's funny, like, uh,

451
00:18:30.974 --> 00:18:31.885
through country.

452
00:18:31.895 --> 00:18:36.665
We've gone, you know, four guards, four wings, two bigs as a general rule.

453
00:18:36.734 --> 00:18:40.564
But a lot of kids fit within that garden wing spot. Anyway.

454
00:18:40.849 --> 00:18:44.780
Uh, I definitely think there's more. Probably your point guards,

455
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.699
your true centres and then everything else is is the reality of where it is.

456
00:18:48.709 --> 00:18:50.709
And I know from a national team perspective,

457
00:18:50.719 --> 00:18:53.150
that's how we looked at it is who can lead

458
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.469
the the group on the floor who can actually defend

459
00:18:56.579 --> 00:19:00.140
a monster five. And then everyone else needs to be interchangeable. So,

460
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.560
um, I think that's something that comes down to your club philosophy.

461
00:19:03.569 --> 00:19:07.150
And also then after that, you your individual coaching philosophy.

462
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.270
What are you most comfortable with? What do you feel?

463
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.599
You really need to have and then evolve it from there,

464
00:19:12.989 --> 00:19:13.729
and it's interesting.

465
00:19:13.739 --> 00:19:16.359
I've I've kind of working with the terminology at the moment,

466
00:19:16.369 --> 00:19:17.930
like you've got ball handling guards,

467
00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:22.089
you've got athletes and you've got posts and you kind of sit in one of those three.

468
00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:26.530
and then there are some some traits that can, you know, get you an extra,

469
00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:32.010
you know, bonus point. Like if you can shoot the ball. That obviously now moves you up

470
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.219
in that in that group, it doesn't matter where you sit in that group,

471
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.089
Um, but it's interesting how

472
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.270
not only us that we evaluate talent,

473
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.609
but the way the NBA and NBL now evaluates talent and builds out their rosters, it's

474
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.089
it's very different to what it was.

475
00:19:45.099 --> 00:19:46.010
Your point right there,

476
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.359
though to me is the thing that we still do

477
00:19:48.369 --> 00:19:52.209
a really poor job of is identifying just true shooters.

478
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.469
Uh, you know, it's the master skill in the game, but we always tend to Alright,

479
00:19:56.479 --> 00:19:59.420
we'll take the athlete over the kid that can just knock it down.

480
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.160
And uh,

481
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.140
it's something that I look at the last

482
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.390
two worlds campaigns that I've been involved in,

483
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.630
you know, and DJ Vasilevich and Dragon

484
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:07.430
KZ

485
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.609
they're the ones that got us wins in big games cos they could just flat out shoot it.

486
00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:13.959
Uh, not necessarily the athletes. So

487
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.479
I think that's something that, you know,

488
00:20:15.489 --> 00:20:17.819
All the discussion we're having is really good.

489
00:20:17.829 --> 00:20:18.329
But then

490
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.500
coming down to really understanding what what matters to you and to me,

491
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:23.400
shooting matters.

492
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.459
And that's where that's where my thought process has gone.

493
00:20:26.469 --> 00:20:27.739
So how do you get that in your trial?

494
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.010
And how do you find the best shooter in your trial when you might

495
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.660
have 50 kids on one court and you're trying to work it out,

496
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.949
which you can actually shoot at them.

497
00:20:34.135 --> 00:20:38.944
So this go comes back to being able to just play and figure it out, because

498
00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:42.344
I think we've all seen, you know, the old trade drills, boys.

499
00:20:42.425 --> 00:20:44.045
You know, I was probably one of them where, you know,

500
00:20:44.055 --> 00:20:47.244
you can shoot uncontested shots till the cows come home, but I couldn't do

501
00:20:47.344 --> 00:20:47.545
that,

502
00:20:48.175 --> 00:20:50.944
but put you in a game, time and space.

503
00:20:50.954 --> 00:20:53.305
But, you know, like, now that really, uh,

504
00:20:53.314 --> 00:20:56.005
determined whether you were really a shooter or not.

505
00:20:56.015 --> 00:20:56.395
And,

506
00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:57.494
um, you know,

507
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.739
uh, Mike McHugh the other week said There's a lot of shooters here,

508
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.930
but not many hitters.

509
00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:03.189
And so we want the hitters.

510
00:21:03.199 --> 00:21:06.420
We want the kids that in games can barely knock down a shot, So

511
00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:10.930
I still believe that that's the way you'll really figure it out is through gameplay.

512
00:21:10.939 --> 00:21:13.630
If you're noticing someone constantly making buckets

513
00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:17.650
and to me, the other part is making sure free throws are part of those games,

514
00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.739
seeing if a kid can step up and hit a free throw cos I think it's an undervalued skill.

515
00:21:22.069 --> 00:21:25.109
Um, but making sure that those elements are there, you're gonna figure it out. Yeah.

516
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.290
Oh,

517
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.530
there was a coach I was watching coach the other

518
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.869
day that had part of scrimmage in their trials.

519
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.239
Uh, and every time they had a trial, if one team won their team,

520
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.949
that one had to make the free throw to keep the win.

521
00:21:34.959 --> 00:21:37.250
Otherwise, it was just game on again and you just keep going.

522
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.569
I think it was like first of four.

523
00:21:38.579 --> 00:21:42.209
If one team got the four first, they'd shoot it if they missed it. Game is still on.

524
00:21:42.219 --> 00:21:42.859
It's just like,

525
00:21:43.489 --> 00:21:43.619
yeah,

526
00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.140
it's all

527
00:21:44.689 --> 00:21:44.900
as well.

528
00:21:45.939 --> 00:21:48.300
Um, does it change from under 12 to under eighteens.

529
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.800
Like I know you guys have just gone through, like, your jamboree selections

530
00:21:51.069 --> 00:21:51.780
for the country.

531
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.489
Guys, we had some ID camps in here for the, uh, for the metro kids as well.

532
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.640
Does it change

533
00:21:57.119 --> 00:21:59.199
in under twelves how you're picking kids,

534
00:21:59.209 --> 00:22:02.579
like do you look for the long-term athlete that you sit there and say, Hey,

535
00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:04.640
you know what might be a little bit raw at the moment?

536
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.130
But in three or four years time, this kid could turn into a long wing.

537
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.010
That could potentially be a few different things

538
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.369
or even picking for the hero now in number 12.

539
00:22:12.469 --> 00:22:15.709
Well, to me, the shopping list doesn't change, but the actual,

540
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.920
uh, greyness in the selection changes.

541
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.939
So there's a lot more grey at under twelves

542
00:22:20.949 --> 00:22:23.219
versus the black and white at under eighteens,

543
00:22:23.229 --> 00:22:24.949
where you either have it or you don't

544
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.859
under twelves. Definitely. You gotta be looking at body type,

545
00:22:28.229 --> 00:22:31.270
you know? Are they a quick learner? An adaptive learner, you know?

546
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.709
Are they comfortable? You know, do they have a little bit of

547
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:37.589
swagger and a bit of confidence? Or are they you know, Are they a punk?

548
00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:40.849
You know, like all those sorts of things at that age where you're trying to

549
00:22:40.979 --> 00:22:43.819
really build long-term development plans.

550
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.510
Uh, I think you know that that all comes into it.

551
00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.569
But the shopping list, in my opinion, stays the same,

552
00:22:48.579 --> 00:22:50.810
and we use the same in under twelves right through.

553
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.050
So the key on that is

554
00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.689
one V. One offence at under twelves means something very different

555
00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:59.020
to an under 18. So

556
00:22:59.199 --> 00:23:01.910
at under twelves, it might be that they can dribble left and right,

557
00:23:02.229 --> 00:23:03.709
you know, So that's one big one offence.

558
00:23:03.719 --> 00:23:07.010
They've got that ability, you know, figure it out and get your loads from there

559
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.630
and with size at the under 12 level, like a lot of the time,

560
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.400
it's hard to project what the little ball handling point guard is

561
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.890
going to to be when he's under 18 or she's under 18.

562
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:22.010
So I think it's a Justin's point, like you have to be careful not to completely,

563
00:23:22.189 --> 00:23:22.930
uh,

564
00:23:23.555 --> 00:23:23.734
you know,

565
00:23:23.744 --> 00:23:27.005
see the development or projection of a particular athlete

566
00:23:27.015 --> 00:23:29.015
purely based on their size and under twelves,

567
00:23:29.025 --> 00:23:29.665
because

568
00:23:29.765 --> 00:23:31.964
they might end up being a legitimate for

569
00:23:32.135 --> 00:23:35.505
handling point guard who has exceptional speed and quickness by

570
00:23:35.515 --> 00:23:38.084
the time and decision making by the time they're 1617.

571
00:23:38.354 --> 00:23:42.875
1 for me has been the under 14 boys leading scorer at nationals is, uh

572
00:23:43.324 --> 00:23:46.885
most times it ends up, that kid disappears within two years.

573
00:23:46.895 --> 00:23:49.604
Cos they were just a man child at that age where

574
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.439
you know the kid, that's kind of somewhere in between ends up you know,

575
00:23:53.449 --> 00:23:55.250
Long-term projecting pretty good.

576
00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.910
So it's understanding that as well, though over the years as a coach,

577
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.680
I think like I'm certain as a younger coach,

578
00:24:01.689 --> 00:24:05.689
it would be like I don't care That guy averaged 20 points a game or whatever.

579
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.300
Uh, as the time goes on, you're having longer-term projections. I think

580
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.099
that changes. But again, at club

581
00:24:11.885 --> 00:24:13.875
where the result is now,

582
00:24:14.145 --> 00:24:16.395
um, sometimes that could help you

583
00:24:16.635 --> 00:24:20.064
kind of progress and and win. And and that's a discussion point as well.

584
00:24:20.324 --> 00:24:23.795
And I think over the last couple of years I mean V, JB L have, uh,

585
00:24:23.805 --> 00:24:26.175
removed zones for under twelves and under fourteens, too.

586
00:24:26.185 --> 00:24:27.454
I think there's been a little bit of, uh,

587
00:24:27.464 --> 00:24:30.324
hesitancy from some coaches to pick the big kids in under twelves

588
00:24:30.334 --> 00:24:32.425
and under Fourteens because there's a little bit of a A.

589
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.530
I don't think they can match up on anyone now. It's more a pressing game.

590
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.560
A man to man principles.

591
00:24:36.569 --> 00:24:39.520
They want the smaller players that can actually cover the ground. Um,

592
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.560
gigs are incredibly valuable to have if you've got them, that can catch and finish.

593
00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:43.959
Um,

594
00:24:43.969 --> 00:24:46.199
but I don't know that you pick kids just because they're big

595
00:24:46.209 --> 00:24:49.109
There is a fine line between Is this kid really raw?

596
00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:51.699
And I can turn them into something. Or are they just a big kid?

597
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.119
Uh, sometimes you just want the most talented kids,

598
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.290
so everyone deserves to be coached.

599
00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.119
So you gotta figure out Well, what's the best fit for them at this point in time?

600
00:25:00.579 --> 00:25:02.839
So, you know, big thing I think we do

601
00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.199
too often is set people up for favour, not success.

602
00:25:06.369 --> 00:25:07.040
And to me,

603
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.099
like part of the selection process should be Where is this

604
00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:14.599
athlete gonna have most success this year for their long-term development versus

605
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.920
most success for me as a coach to be able to win right now

606
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.800
so that that kind of really has to come into that equation? I think so.

607
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.479
Is it about you or is it about the players? Is It

608
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.410
should be about the

609
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:25.180
players,

610
00:25:26.359 --> 00:25:30.420
with, um to the point about post players or bigger players at a younger age.

611
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.119
For them to get better, they need the ball thrown to them,

612
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.140
uh, for their psyche. They need to feel like the ball's getting thrown to them,

613
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.609
because in basketball, if we don't throw the ball to them in the post,

614
00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:41.500
they won't develop.

615
00:25:41.739 --> 00:25:45.099
And if they go and play football and they get told to play in the ruck,

616
00:25:45.119 --> 00:25:48.030
they're gonna get told to follow the ball wherever it goes on that day,

617
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.290
and they're gonna get their hands on it an awful lot.

618
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.020
So we have to kind of take that into consideration, too.

619
00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.380
Like, yeah, they might turn it over a couple of times.

620
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:56.630
But we do have to,

621
00:25:56.969 --> 00:26:00.140
you know, if they're on their team, you've got to coach them. Yep, absolutely.

622
00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.689
I think it's, um, a really valuable thing as well.

623
00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:05.140
When you start looking at trolls, maybe to the younger age groups,

624
00:26:05.469 --> 00:26:07.390
uh, you probably stay away from set

625
00:26:07.545 --> 00:26:11.734
offences, uh, a little bit more and just give them some basic rules. I think five

626
00:26:11.905 --> 00:26:13.834
has been around forever. It's nothing but ill

627
00:26:14.295 --> 00:26:16.165
to me. Receiver Spot should be

628
00:26:16.295 --> 00:26:19.915
universally known by every Australian athlete coming through cos

629
00:26:19.925 --> 00:26:23.214
that is a big factor Long-term for those athletes.

630
00:26:23.224 --> 00:26:24.305
But outside of that,

631
00:26:24.564 --> 00:26:25.814
um, yeah, absolutely.

632
00:26:25.824 --> 00:26:28.094
It's It should come down to what they can do and

633
00:26:28.104 --> 00:26:31.665
and let them trial and error in a positive environment.

634
00:26:32.305 --> 00:26:35.145
So what are the some of the mistakes you guys have made?

635
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.469
The trials. It's, uh I know the first time I ever went to one of my trials.

636
00:26:39.569 --> 00:26:41.989
I was coaching the 14 2 girls and I sat there

637
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.839
watching these kids get up and down and I'm like,

638
00:26:43.849 --> 00:26:46.140
Man, these are the best five or six athletes there.

639
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.530
At no stage I was ever gonna get those kids. They were never gonna fall to me.

640
00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.099
And I spent the entire time watching the best kids,

641
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.959
knowing that I had the twos and I screwed that up.

642
00:26:53.969 --> 00:26:54.180
Roy.

643
00:26:54.689 --> 00:26:56.500
It's what are some of the things that you can

644
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.709
sort of steer coaches away from making the same error?

645
00:26:59.180 --> 00:26:59.780
Do you want me to go

646
00:26:59.949 --> 00:27:01.500
up or you go? I think that's a good point.

647
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:05.699
Like make sure that you're not fixated on one or two kids. That's that's critical.

648
00:27:05.709 --> 00:27:06.280
Um,

649
00:27:06.949 --> 00:27:08.540
having multiple coaches

650
00:27:08.689 --> 00:27:09.329
with

651
00:27:09.689 --> 00:27:12.810
multiple sets of eyes on kids is really important at a selection.

652
00:27:12.819 --> 00:27:15.609
Because at the end of the day, when we go into a room like this

653
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.290
and talk about you know, number 24

654
00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.760
there has to be more than just one viewpoint on the

655
00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:25.969
ale. Like, let's build up the athlete's case to make this team make this squad.

656
00:27:25.979 --> 00:27:27.130
Whatever the case, maybe,

657
00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.040
uh, finding the good in every athlete is really important as well.

658
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:35.359
Like, these athletes are all here because they do something really well.

659
00:27:35.489 --> 00:27:37.560
Uh, our job, we coach everybody.

660
00:27:37.569 --> 00:27:42.050
Our job as coaches is to be able to use that elite talent or their skill,

661
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:42.920
whatever they've got

662
00:27:43.449 --> 00:27:46.109
for the best of their game and then for our team. So,

663
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.579
uh, a lot of the time we look for athletes that can do all kinds of things. I think

664
00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.400
I think that as well as involving that skill as a

665
00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.170
coach and just being able to find something good in people like

666
00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.020
I mean, how often do you does a coach come and tell you this kid can't do this?

667
00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.430
can't do that. Can't do that.

668
00:28:01.859 --> 00:28:04.880
Often. I'll throw at them. Well, what can they do? And they look at you blank.

669
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.319
It's like, you know, that should be the first mindset. What can that kid do

670
00:28:08.709 --> 00:28:13.290
right now? Can they do enough to warrant selection? If they can't, that's OK,

671
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.839
but find what what they can do.

672
00:28:16.189 --> 00:28:17.439
Uh, to me, the other

673
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.770
big errors in the past is just

674
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:21.239
one preconceived

675
00:28:21.359 --> 00:28:23.199
ideas on what wouldn't work.

676
00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:26.300
So, you know, if someone didn't have something Oh, well,

677
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.239
they can't play for me like that

678
00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:33.339
to me, over time has just been a recipe of failure for, uh, guaranteed

679
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:34.849
hands down. And

680
00:28:35.069 --> 00:28:39.430
I guess the the other parts that you know really matter in selection

681
00:28:39.589 --> 00:28:41.750
is like just making it comfortable.

682
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.250
You know, like, you know, early days, I want it to be ruthless and, you know, hard.

683
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:46.869
But like

684
00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:49.140
actually, we want to see the kids at their best,

685
00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.619
So finding a way to give them a little bit of comfort.

686
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.619
Massive thing is getting to know their actual

687
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.339
name and call them by their actual name.

688
00:28:55.349 --> 00:28:55.790
Not,

689
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.790
you know, saying Michelle instead of Michael, you know,

690
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.579
like that can really mess with the kid's head on that day.

691
00:29:01.589 --> 00:29:05.319
Like those are the probably the little things that don't seem like a lot.

692
00:29:05.329 --> 00:29:06.140
But ultimately,

693
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.430
you're gonna get a better evaluation of the kid cos they're nervous coming in.

694
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:10.229
They're

695
00:29:10.339 --> 00:29:14.219
nervous. Their parents are nervous. Uh, so if you can draw that level of comfort,

696
00:29:14.974 --> 00:29:16.834
you know, the family as they come on in?

697
00:29:17.045 --> 00:29:18.954
Uh, yeah, absolutely. Because, yeah,

698
00:29:19.255 --> 00:29:19.525
they'll be

699
00:29:19.675 --> 00:29:19.885
nervous

700
00:29:20.035 --> 00:29:20.165
anyway.

701
00:29:20.295 --> 00:29:23.185
Yeah, and I think you've been hit on a really valuable one there.

702
00:29:23.194 --> 00:29:24.604
And the parents are nervous as well.

703
00:29:24.614 --> 00:29:25.074
Like, I mean,

704
00:29:25.084 --> 00:29:27.734
I went to bottom age under 12 trials on Sunday morning

705
00:29:27.744 --> 00:29:30.555
and within about two minutes of doing a contested layout drill,

706
00:29:30.704 --> 00:29:33.265
uh, we had two parents on the court trying to coach their kids.

707
00:29:33.275 --> 00:29:35.515
I mean, they're they're not bad people because of it,

708
00:29:35.525 --> 00:29:37.234
but they're just really nervous for their kids

709
00:29:38.025 --> 00:29:41.314
as well. For coaches, especially young coaches. Not be

710
00:29:41.709 --> 00:29:44.770
afraid to converse with parents like

711
00:29:45.209 --> 00:29:46.869
I know you know you you always

712
00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:49.089
as a younger coach, you'll always get your backups.

713
00:29:49.099 --> 00:29:50.949
You think Oh, you know, they're judging me. But

714
00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.569
the reality is, the more communication you got,

715
00:29:53.579 --> 00:29:56.449
the better chance you've got of everything running smoothly on

716
00:29:56.459 --> 00:29:59.989
that day and and just setting clear guidelines and clear,

717
00:30:00.079 --> 00:30:01.709
clear framework around.

718
00:30:01.719 --> 00:30:03.479
This is what we're gonna do. This is how the day will

719
00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:04.800
go

720
00:30:04.959 --> 00:30:05.000
from

721
00:30:05.189 --> 00:30:05.280
there.

722
00:30:05.469 --> 00:30:05.719
Yeah,

723
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.540
and every parent interaction is in conflict. It's really easy

724
00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:09.689
to

725
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:09.969
think that

726
00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.189
it's sometimes they're just generally nice people saying, Hey,

727
00:30:13.459 --> 00:30:15.180
uh, and the kid's forgotten his drink bottle.

728
00:30:15.189 --> 00:30:18.040
I'll just throw it to him And, you know, I'm just telling him it's over there on that,

729
00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.000
Ben, it's It's those sorts of things as well.

730
00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:20.380
So

731
00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:21.040
it's,

732
00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.719
um it's just a different world when you're

733
00:30:22.729 --> 00:30:24.140
getting into the trial because everyone is on.

734
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:28.130
I think that's also part of evaluation as well. If the kid looking you know

735
00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.199
there's not much separation there from Mum and Dad,

736
00:30:31.209 --> 00:30:33.010
then that's an athlete that you know.

737
00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.079
You're gonna have to spend time on that with so everything.

738
00:30:36.089 --> 00:30:37.449
You're constantly being evaluated.

739
00:30:37.459 --> 00:30:41.000
We say to our green and gold athletes all the time. You're always being evaluated.

740
00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:42.729
That's mum and dad, too. You know,

741
00:30:42.969 --> 00:30:43.270
that's

742
00:30:43.569 --> 00:30:43.640
reality.

743
00:30:43.724 --> 00:30:44.814
That's really, really,

744
00:30:44.824 --> 00:30:48.344
really important that these athletes and families know that

745
00:30:48.545 --> 00:30:51.744
this evaluation goes longer than a three hour camp in Shepparton

746
00:30:51.974 --> 00:30:52.464
or wherever it

747
00:30:52.574 --> 00:30:56.535
is like this evaluation goes January 1 through to December 31.

748
00:30:56.564 --> 00:30:58.635
Uh, everything you do is

749
00:30:59.334 --> 00:31:00.765
towards a certain goal,

750
00:31:00.775 --> 00:31:04.545
and we constantly evaluate whether it's on the floor off the floor.

751
00:31:04.555 --> 00:31:07.854
Uh, and cultures in our pathway are being evaluated, too. All the

752
00:31:08.035 --> 00:31:08.114
same,

753
00:31:09.275 --> 00:31:11.194
we preach a lot is

754
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:14.510
just cos you don't make it doesn't mean you're not a good athlete.

755
00:31:14.979 --> 00:31:16.540
Just because you don't make it

756
00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.239
doesn't mean that the next person isn't going to

757
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.180
think you're good enough like selections are subjective.

758
00:31:22.189 --> 00:31:22.520
So

759
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:26.339
really trying to give that framework on this is what we feel right now.

760
00:31:26.349 --> 00:31:28.329
This is why you've missed out. But,

761
00:31:28.569 --> 00:31:31.680
you know, and likewise, if they make it, you know, again, that's subjective.

762
00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:34.459
You know, you might have the next coach who goes well. No, I don't agree with that.

763
00:31:34.469 --> 00:31:38.199
You're not good enough at that and and being able to deal with that and handle that so

764
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.479
and you gotta be across your athletes with that as well.

765
00:31:40.489 --> 00:31:41.359
I think, um,

766
00:31:41.449 --> 00:31:44.310
sometimes there's more value in being the 10th kid in the

767
00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:46.329
first team rather than the first kid in the second team.

768
00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:46.790
and other times

769
00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:47.939
flips. It's It

770
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:49.890
is one of those things where coaches are going to be

771
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.180
a little bit selective about who they choose for their team,

772
00:31:52.189 --> 00:31:52.609
obviously.

773
00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:54.300
But if you're not gonna play the kid,

774
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:57.050
you're probably better off not picking them like let them go and play.

775
00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.770
What do you guys feel about how many kids should be in the team?

776
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.489
Like I've got some pretty strong views on that? I always just thought it was 10.

777
00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:07.739
Yeah, but since I've been in the role in the last, you know, six or seven months,

778
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:10.380
I've learnt that there are some associations that,

779
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.979
um depending on what the team is within the age group, uh,

780
00:32:12.989 --> 00:32:15.010
gravitate towards a nine or an eight.

781
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:16.430
So that's

782
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:17.869
I think it's interesting.

783
00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:17.979
A

784
00:32:18.089 --> 00:32:21.150
year older kids can probably deal with 10 cos they tend to deal with, uh,

785
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.170
injuries a little bit more like they have longer-term Injuries like

786
00:32:24.579 --> 00:32:26.930
11 and 12 year olds seem to bounce back from a rolled

787
00:32:26.939 --> 00:32:29.069
ankle within about seven or eight minutes most of the time,

788
00:32:29.079 --> 00:32:32.430
whereas an under 18 athlete, they roll an ankle that can be anywhere from

789
00:32:32.709 --> 00:32:34.229
two weeks to six weeks, so

790
00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:37.650
My big thing on it is you don't get better unless you play

791
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.089
like you can train every single day.

792
00:32:40.349 --> 00:32:44.270
Unless you get to try an error in a real 40 minute game,

793
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.520
chances are you're not gonna get better.

794
00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.010
So I'm I'm massive on, you know,

795
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.920
VC level being nine players and then anything underneath eight.

796
00:32:52.199 --> 00:32:53.520
Because you know, I want

797
00:32:53.849 --> 00:32:55.689
the athlete to be able to play. And you know, what?

798
00:32:55.699 --> 00:32:57.829
If there's only seven players there one week, well,

799
00:32:57.839 --> 00:33:00.750
that's just a little bit more pressure, like that's my mindset with it.

800
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.270
I definitely agree with teams going to nationals and

801
00:33:03.589 --> 00:33:06.729
the back to back to, you know, th those sorts of events

802
00:33:06.849 --> 00:33:09.150
definitely need 10, if not 12.

803
00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.640
But, uh, you know, the weak gap in between, I think, really,

804
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.709
you know, the only challenge on that is well,

805
00:33:15.719 --> 00:33:19.319
what this practise environment look like need 10, etcetera, etcetera.

806
00:33:19.329 --> 00:33:19.630
And

807
00:33:19.859 --> 00:33:22.489
I fully understand that, but from a absolute

808
00:33:22.939 --> 00:33:24.619
development mindset,

809
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.880
I really believe that you gotta give the kids

810
00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.060
an opportunity to play and some meaningful minutes,

811
00:33:29.069 --> 00:33:30.670
not your two minutes.

812
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.949
Yeah, and that's it. Like, it's gotta be some meaningful minutes.

813
00:33:34.609 --> 00:33:35.560
Uh, so

814
00:33:35.949 --> 00:33:38.640
we've got to that point where we're comfortable with our teams, they're all picked.

815
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.880
They're all selected. We've got our four or five teams. Whatever the case, maybe

816
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.640
How are you guys announcing them?

817
00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:47.219
Because I know from like, I mean, I'll speak from a V JB L level

818
00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.969
if you want to take the state level and just and take the aus level,

819
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.579
Um, like, I know from a V JB L level, I screwed it up, Uh,

820
00:33:53.589 --> 00:33:56.079
one of the first years I ever did this, and we announced it online,

821
00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.319
which, you know, no issue with that. A lot of clubs do do that.

822
00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:02.390
Uh, the issue is we announced it it at sort of 10 a.m.

823
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.599
on a school day.

824
00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:04.839
Um,

825
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.650
you know, technology being what it is,

826
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.290
kids were very adept at jumping online and finding out they may

827
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.879
have missed the first team and that ends their world fairly quickly.

828
00:34:13.688 --> 00:34:15.120
This is also true,

829
00:34:15.958 --> 00:34:17.590
moving forward potentially as well. But

830
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:18.620
I was also there,

831
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:20.458
the kid that got picked so I wasn't really thinking

832
00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.600
about you know how this kid's rolled out either.

833
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:22.958
So

834
00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:26.760
it's it is one of those things where, uh, you need to be a little bit mindful, and

835
00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:29.418
it's now become a little bit of a practise that, hey,

836
00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:31.899
teams will go up at 5 p.m. on a weekday.

837
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:32.438
So

838
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.649
at least that way, if the kids are checking as well,

839
00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:36.610
they're more likely to have family around them.

840
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.280
So whether they've been disappointed or

841
00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:40.989
if they're disappointed or if they're happy,

842
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.688
they've at least got a little bit of a support network there

843
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:43.270
as well.

844
00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:43.500
Yeah, uh,

845
00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:46.688
selection for, uh, state teams this year varied.

846
00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:49.129
We had some coaches make phone calls,

847
00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:52.938
We had some send emails and we had some announce it on the day after selection.

848
00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:54.050
Uh, with our state teams,

849
00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.489
uh, again, that was a comfort level thing with the coach.

850
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.270
In all cases, though, uh, feedback provided,

851
00:35:01.409 --> 00:35:02.979
uh, at the athlete's discretion.

852
00:35:02.989 --> 00:35:05.550
As soon as you want that feedback or you want to meet with the coach,

853
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.739
then all of that is, uh,

854
00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.979
is definitely available to the athletes.

855
00:35:08.989 --> 00:35:12.739
Uh, with NITP selection this year, we sent, uh, snail mail

856
00:35:13.239 --> 00:35:14.600
a little bit of, uh, handwrit ma

857
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:14.850
or

858
00:35:14.989 --> 00:35:16.669
hand sign mail out to the athletes

859
00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:17.879
waiting.

860
00:35:20.229 --> 00:35:21.250
2017.

861
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:25.479
Um, which I just liked from, um, from my perspective,

862
00:35:25.489 --> 00:35:27.770
and I've still got letters that I have at or

863
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.060
Mum and Dad's house from that I received as a junior

864
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.780
your signatures on some kids walls at the moment with their, uh,

865
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.310
their framed in ITP letter or

866
00:35:35.669 --> 00:35:35.699
one

867
00:35:35.899 --> 00:35:35.989
of the

868
00:35:43.949 --> 00:35:44.879
It's at a

869
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.560
level.

870
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:50.570
So I guess ours is, um, we've only got 16 to 18 athletes in camp,

871
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.290
so it's really personal from start to end.

872
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:53.770
Uh,

873
00:35:54.189 --> 00:35:57.020
we would meet as a full staff with each athlete

874
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.719
the process we went through with the recent, uh, selection,

875
00:36:00.729 --> 00:36:02.129
and seventeens was basically

876
00:36:02.459 --> 00:36:05.459
let the athlete give us feedback on how they felt they went.

877
00:36:05.469 --> 00:36:08.179
And we added that to their rhythm feedback

878
00:36:08.189 --> 00:36:10.780
that went back to the state high performance manager

879
00:36:10.889 --> 00:36:13.879
and to the athlete, which, uh is the first time we've done that.

880
00:36:13.889 --> 00:36:15.479
But I found it really valuable that

881
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.770
there was a column there that they could see how they

882
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.570
felt and mirrored that up with with how we felt,

883
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.439
um, successful nonsuccessive.

884
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:26.870
Every athlete got written feedback, but it is short and sharp. It's, uh,

885
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.870
one of the processes we use is we provide

886
00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:31.989
two dot points that

887
00:36:32.229 --> 00:36:33.699
this is how we feel you went,

888
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.270
Congrats. You're in or sorry you were unsuccessful so that

889
00:36:38.489 --> 00:36:40.860
we've given them the info before they hear either of that,

890
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:43.540
because the second they hear that they're not thinking about it.

891
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.919
And it

892
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.489
it's tough. Like, uh,

893
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.929
it's probably the worst part.

894
00:36:46.939 --> 00:36:49.659
And the best part about coaching is telling a kid they've made

895
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:54.330
a national team. And then to also tell a kid that they haven't right now. But

896
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.469
that's been the process we've used in in previous campaigns. Very similar.

897
00:36:58.479 --> 00:37:02.129
Yeah, uh, face to face. So in terms of giving feedback, uh, you sort of say,

898
00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.409
two dot points that I like you discussed that kids can ask feedback as well.

899
00:37:06.429 --> 00:37:09.120
Uh, I've always gone, um, similar two

900
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:09.840
points.

901
00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.209
Uh, but I usually put them under the headings of Stop, start, keep, uh, things.

902
00:37:13.219 --> 00:37:14.340
We need you to stop doing things.

903
00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.300
We need you to start doing things you need to keep doing,

904
00:37:16.409 --> 00:37:19.330
um, and just sort of break it up a little bit for them that way as well,

905
00:37:19.389 --> 00:37:22.790
Because generally all our feedback is always written.

906
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.580
So while verbal feedback

907
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.419
is always give them in in writing form,

908
00:37:27.739 --> 00:37:33.959
um, we would always frame from a you know, big country point of view around those five

909
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.010
key selection areas.

910
00:37:36.169 --> 00:37:37.629
Um, the AUS one's very different.

911
00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:41.040
It's more than two dot points, but it's it's just a you know,

912
00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.449
this is basically where you're at sort of thing, really kind of detailed to,

913
00:37:45.699 --> 00:37:47.419
but not, but not overkill.

914
00:37:48.659 --> 00:37:49.899
12 things. It's

915
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:54.290
23 things and away you go metro similar. Like you have to have that shopping list.

916
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.060
Like, how are these athletes being evaluated? That should be clear cut for them.

917
00:37:58.399 --> 00:38:02.419
Uh, and then the feedback not only just giving them feedback around those points,

918
00:38:02.659 --> 00:38:03.919
but this is how

919
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:06.419
good athletes in the past have addressed this.

920
00:38:06.429 --> 00:38:06.600
You know,

921
00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.000
they've become better one on one players by doing

922
00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:12.229
X or they've become better shooters by doing X.

923
00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:15.604
Uh, cos that's important because you I hope that the athlete takes the feedback,

924
00:38:15.774 --> 00:38:19.044
uh, and then starts to develop that resilient mindset to OK,

925
00:38:19.054 --> 00:38:21.054
I'll take this on and get better at this.

926
00:38:21.064 --> 00:38:22.485
So next time I show up,

927
00:38:22.625 --> 00:38:24.564
uh, I'm gonna get selected. Definitely.

928
00:38:24.574 --> 00:38:27.104
And it's one of those things, too, where, I mean, especially at the, uh,

929
00:38:27.114 --> 00:38:28.655
the state or the aus level,

930
00:38:28.794 --> 00:38:31.905
Just because they miss out on a team doesn't mean they're a bad player, you know,

931
00:38:31.995 --> 00:38:33.574
Usually they're a very talented player.

932
00:38:33.584 --> 00:38:35.715
They just may not fit what's around them at the moment.

933
00:38:35.895 --> 00:38:39.175
And then the other thing is, every athlete deserves feedback,

934
00:38:39.185 --> 00:38:40.715
like every single athlete.

935
00:38:40.725 --> 00:38:41.094
And,

936
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.090
um, you know, often one of the hard ones is when

937
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.479
you've gone through success with an athlete and then they miss out on the next team

938
00:38:48.899 --> 00:38:50.239
how, you know, like, but

939
00:38:50.489 --> 00:38:53.290
that same athlete still deserves that feedback. You can't just go.

940
00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.649
Oh, well, you know, I don't want to deal with that cos it's hard.

941
00:38:55.659 --> 00:38:58.879
Every single athlete deserves fever. And what's their response to it as well?

942
00:38:58.889 --> 00:38:59.439
Yeah, it's, uh,

943
00:38:59.449 --> 00:39:01.989
and that's something we'll talk about in some of the later podcasts in terms

944
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
of how to deal with athletes that

945
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.669
may experience disappointment and things like that.

946
00:39:04.679 --> 00:39:04.959
But

947
00:39:05.229 --> 00:39:07.020
that's where we'll go for now. It, uh,

948
00:39:07.449 --> 00:39:10.330
that is us for this week, thanks to all our listeners as well.

949
00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.129

950
00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:15.090
your parents, my parents, um, you know,

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.489
Listen to this, but hopefully along the way,

953
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.429
this go gains a little bit of a following,

954
00:39:21.439 --> 00:39:23.570
and we get a little bit of interaction as well with, uh,

955
00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.969
