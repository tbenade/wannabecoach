## Goal of Wannabecoach

## Motivation
I was a day zero coach once. Standing in front of a group of enthusiastic athletes and their parents terrified, overwhelmed but desperate to do the athletes and the great game justice.

I hope our content has found you before or near that first session and we can take turn some of the unknowns into excitement and confidence. if you haven't had the pleasure of coaching before, you are in for a wild ride that can be fantastically rewarding.
