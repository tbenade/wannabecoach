# Talking Split - Helping hand

Talking Split Podcast is an educational, inspiring, motivating and entertaining audio resource created by the incredibly generous staff at Basketball Victoria. 

In a single episode you might hear how the Australian national team train defensive rotations in preparation for the Olympics and what the ideal height of a hoop is for 8 year olds.

As you can imagine those might be two entirely different target audiences with vastly different experiences and basketball vocabularies. 

This resource hopes to capture all the words and terms we didn't know as novice coaches and offer you a bite sized explanation and deep dives when available.

Again the goal being to give you back your time while leaving just that smidgen wiser with the tiniest investment.
